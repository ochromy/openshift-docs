=== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the event-based pruner failed to process `PipelineRun` objects in the specified namespace when the `historyLimit` value was set to `0`, causing persistent `PipelineRun` objects in running state. With this release, the pruner is updated to handle `PipelineRun` objects when `historyLimit` is set to `0`, ensuring they are pruned and improving resource management and efficiency.

* Before this update, structured logs for {pac} lacked detailed source repository information from the initiating webhook request. With this release, logs for {pac} now include complete source repository details, making it easier for operators to identify user-reported issues.

* Before this update, invalid Cloud Event Language (CEL) expressions in {pac} `PipelineRun` configurations could lead to silent `PipelineRun` trigger failures. With this update, {pac} now detects and reports invalid CEL expressions in pull requests by directly commenting on pull requests with error messages.

* Before this update, the {OCP} Console stated a 'Cancelling' state for `PipelineRun` objects with failed `finally` tasks on {OCP} 4.15.36 and {pipelines-shortname} 1.16, even when the actual status of the `PipelineRun` was `Canceled`, causing confusion. With this release, the issue is fixed.

* Before this update, the `PipelineRun` Events tab did not show events when using {pipelines-shortname} 1.18.1 on {OCP} 4.17 or 4.18.18, due to an issue with the Pipeline Console plugin. As a consequence, you could not monitor the events in real-time. With this release, the `PipelineRun` Events tab now displays events in {pipelines-shortname} 1.18.1.

* Before this update, running `fbc-fips-check-oci-ta` taks during git cloning caused temporary resource unavailability, stalling the git resolver and preventing the resolution of `ResolutionRequests`. This resulted in a build failure with the following error message: `cannot fork() for remote-https: Resource temporarily unavailable`. With this release, the issue is fixed.

* Before this update, the pipeline builder fetched only a limited number of tasks from {artifact-hub}, resulting in some tasks not being availiable. This resulted in an incomplete pipeline creation. With this release, the interface now fetches the complete list of tasks from {artifact-hub} on search, showing all available tasks in the pipeline builder.
