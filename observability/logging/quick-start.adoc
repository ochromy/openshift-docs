OpenShift Logging supports two data models:

* ViaQ (General Availability)
* OpenTelemetry (Technology Preview)

You can select either of these data models based on your requirement by configuring the `lokiStack.dataModel` field in the `ClusterLogForwarder`. ViaQ is the default data model when forwarding logs to LokiStack.

[NOTE]
====
In future releases of OpenShift Logging, the default data model will change from ViaQ to OpenTelemetry.
